# GameGenius: A Game Recommendation Engine Web App

Welcome to GameGenius! This project combines the power of Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, machine learning, and Streamlit to create a web application that recommends video games to users based on their preferences and gaming history.<br>

## Project Overview

GameGenius is divided into several components:<br>

1. **Data Extraction:** We use Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from Rwag gaming website, including game titles, genres, description, and more. This data serves as the foundation for our recommendation system.<br>

2. **Recommendation System:** Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze the collected gaming data to build a robust recommendation system. This system suggests games to users based on the game choosen by the user.<br>

3. **Web Application:** We create a user-friendly web app using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the recommendation system. Users can input their gaming preferences and view recommended games.<br>


# Usage

Input their prefered game and get recommendation for games like the one choosen.<br>
View recommended games based on their input and gaming history.<br>
Explore detailed information about each recommended game, including user reviews, release date, and more.<br>
